# Event Mapper

## Scenario
• Your program should randomly generate seed data.

• Your program should operate in a world that ranges from -10 to +10 (Y axis), and -10 to +10 (X axis).

• Your program should assume that each co-ordinate can hold a maximum of one event.

• Each event has a unique numeric identifier (e.g. 1, 2, 3).

• Each event has zero or more tickets.

• Each ticket has a non-zero price, expressed in US Dollars.

• The distance between two points should be computed as the Manhattan distance.

## Instructions
You are required to write a program which accepts a user location as a pair of co- ordinates, and returns a list of the five closest events, along with the cheapest ticket price for each event.
